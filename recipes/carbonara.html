        <p><i> For once not with pancetta, but with chorizo ​​sausage for a surprisingly spicy effect.</i> </p>
        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Spaghetti -500g </li>
            <li>Eggs -4 </li>
            <li>grated parmesan-50g</li>

            <li>leaf parsley-1 bunch</li>
            <li>pepper and salt- as per taste</li>
            </i>
        </ul> 
        <h3> Preparation</h3>
        <ol> <i>
         <li> Boil the spaghetti in salted water. Beat the eggs in a bowl and season them with salt and pepper. Cut the chorizo ​​into slices and finely chop the flat-leaf parsley. </li><br>
         <li> Drain the spaghetti and keep some of the cooking liquid.</li><br>
         <li> Fry the chorizo ​​in a frying pan for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the fire and let it cool down. Then add the spaghetti and mix in the egg mixture and some of the cooking liquid. Turn the heat back on and gently warm the pasta a little. <strong>(Note: the eggs must not coagulate)</strong>. Keep a little parmesan aside for the finish and mix the rest under the pasta.</li><br>
         <li> Spoon the spaghetti onto the plates. Finish with some finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, grated parmesan and a twist of the pepper mill. </li><br>
         <li> And finally enjoy the carbonara with a glass of wine aside.  </li> </i><br>
